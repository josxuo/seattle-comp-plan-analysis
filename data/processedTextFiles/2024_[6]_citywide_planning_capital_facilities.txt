Capital Facilities
Introduction
Capital facilities are major assets that have a long useful life. Maintaining, improving, and expanding capital facilities is critical for sustaining a high-quality of life as the city grows and making our facilities more efficient, carbon neutral, and equitable. The City cannot fully deliver on our City service or policy priorities without investments in the places where our City workforce performs their work and where community members meet their needs, especially in areas of the city planned for future growth and development.
The Capital Facilities element addresses facilities owned by the City and managed by various City departments: police and fire, parks and recreation, libraries, neighborhood service centers, City office space, arts and cultural space, the Seattle Center, the Central Waterfront, animal shelter, training facilities, and various shops, yards, and warehouses. The facilities and infrastructure of City- operated utilities are also capital facilities but are funded mostly by rate revenues (and are covered in the Utilities element of this Plan). Capital facilities owned and managed by other public entities

that serve Seattle residents include schools, hospitals, and transit. The City also helps to fund community-led capital projects, including projects that are designed to counter displacement or address past discrimination and community underinvestment. Examples of recent community-led capital projects include cultural spaces, affordable housing, open space, and early learning facilities.
Each year the City funds capital facility projects including new facilities, improvements to existing facilities, and rehabilitation or restoration of existing facilities. Projects may address an existing deficiency, a community need related to growth, or community needs not related to growth but that enhance the quality of life. Overall, the City's network of capital facilities, serving an area that is already highly urbanized, is generally sufficient to accommodate forecasted housing and job growth through 2044.
The Capital Facilities element provides guidance for all City-owned capital facilities as well as guidance for coordination with other public entities that serve Seattle. The Capital Facilities Appendix includes an inventory and analysis of future need for City-owned facilities, as well as information about capital facilities owned by other public entities. Policy direction, inventories, and forecast of future need for some capital facilities are addressed in other elements and appendices (see Figure 18). The Capital Facilities element includes a six-year plan for financing capital facilities. This information is contained in Seattle's Capital Improvement Program which is updated as part of the City's annual budget process and is included in this Comprehensive Plan by reference.

Strategic Planning and Investment
DISCUSSION
The City leverages funding from federal, state, and regional governments to augment City funds and utility revenues to maintain and improve our capital facilities network to meet the city's needs as we grow. The investment decisions we make will have long-term implications for our ability to serve a changing population. Establishing strategic priorities for our investments will help the City implement needed improvements efficiently and with limited resources.
Priorities for investment reflect our shared values such as equity, sustainability, life/safety, as well as regulatory requirements in developing and prioritizing capital facility projects. Additional prioritization criteria may be introduced by certain funding sources, state and federal laws, and City resolutions, ordinances, and Executive Orders.
GOAL

CF G1	The City sets clear priorities among potential capital projects to meet the needs of a growing city and to maximize long-term environmental, economic, equity, health, and other benefits.
POLICIES

CF 1.1	Identify new or improved capital facilities needed to support the location and intensity of housing and employment growth anticipated in the growth strategy.
CF 1.2	Implement processes for regularly evaluating capital facility needs and updating planned projects and funding to meet these needs.
CF 1.3	Identify and periodically review criteria to help set priorities among potential capital facility investments.
CF 1.4	Identify opportunities to co-locate capital facilities that include multiple uses, mixed- use development, joint-use, reuse, and repurposing of existing City-owned land and buildings.
CF 1.5	Protect, enhance, and adaptively reuse City-owned historic facilities.


Sustainable Design and Construction
DISCUSSION
The City of Seattle owns and maintains over 650 buildings totaling approximately 10 million square feet. Each year existing facilities are improved, and some new facilities are built. In addition, the City manages more than 110,000 acres of public land, including land outside the city boundary. To reduce its environmental impact, the City has adopted policies and programs to address the sustainability of new building construction and major renovations, as well as day-to-day operations. These policies are more urgent as we increase efforts to combat climate change and adapt to its

impacts. Reducing the environmental impacts related to capital facilities can also address environmental justice goals.
The City adopted its first Sustainable Building Policy in 2000, and a more ambitious policy in 2011, to improve the environmental performance and resiliency of City-owned buildings and sites. Since 2011, the green building industry has continued to innovate and introduce new approaches and standards. These policies not only achieve substantial cost savings but also demonstrate leadership by raising public awareness of the benefits of carbon pollution reductions, promoting clean energy, and inspiring others to adopt similar practices.
GOAL

CF G2	Capital facility projects are designed to achieve resiliency, sustainability, high levels of environmental performance, zero carbon pollution, and minimal environmental impacts consistent with principles of environmental justice.
POLICIES

CF 2.1	Periodically review and amend Seattle's Sustainable Building Policy to reflect best practices, innovations, and other City priorities, particularly those related to embodied carbon in building materials.
CF 2.2	Meet the minimum requirements of the adopted green building standard and pursue opportunities to achieve a higher level of environmental sustainability and resilience through capital facility pilot projects.
CF 2.3	Establish minimum standards for construction practices or building features not yet included in the Sustainable Building Policy or required by the Land Use Code.
CF 2.4	Achieve high levels of energy and water efficiency in capital facilities.

CF 2.5	Employ landscape best management practices that achieve multiple environmental, economic, and social health benefits in capital facilities.
CF 2.6	Site and design capital facilities to be resilient to future climate impacts and other natural hazards, such as earthquake and liquefaction-prone areas, to ensure capital facilities function as intended over their planned life cycle.
CF 2.7	Adapt existing capital facilities to be resilient to the impacts of climate change, natural hazards, and human-made disasters.
CF 2.8	Promote physical activity in the design of capital facilities through features such as the placement and design of stairs, elevators, and indoor and outdoor spaces.
CF 2.9		Incorporate and integrate art into facility design, such as by including artists on the design team and integrating commissioned art into the building and site design.
CF 2.10	When siting new capital facilities, select locations that: support efficient delivery of services,

are accessible to pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users,
maximize value to local community, especially communities that have experienced historical underinvestment,
avoid the impacts of climate change, and minimize impacts to the natural environment.
CF 2.11	Support the City of Seattle's tree canopy cover goals by maximizing tree canopy cover potential of capital project sites where compatible with proposed uses.
CF 2.12	Design capital facilities so they feel safe and welcoming to a wide variety of people.

CF 2.13	Where applicable, design new capital facilities to incorporate reused and recycled content building materials and to better enable deconstruction at the building's end of life.
CF 2.14	Prioritize adaptive reuse or deconstruction for aging or surplus capital facilities.


Equitable Capital Facilities and Services
DISCUSSION
In the past, the planning of capital facilities did not fully consider impacts on underserved and vulnerable communities. This has resulted in a distribution of public amenities and necessary facilities with inequitable benefits and impacts for adjacent communities. We recognize the impacts of climate change disproportionately affect vulnerable communities, making it harder for them to avoid and recover from climate impacts. The City's commitment to race and social justice has changed the capital planning process to ensure equity is considered in the earliest stages of planning.
The City has increased funding to support community-initiated capital projects. Communities play a role in initiating capital projects implemented by City departments and in directly developing capital projects that involve land, buildings, and other physical structures. This model is especially important in communities that have experienced past disinvestment and harm. This community- driven model for capital projects has proven successful for various capital facilities and builds the capacity of community organizations.
The City is leveraging its capital investments to expand opportunities for underrepresented communities, as well as women- and minority-owned contractors. For example, the City's Priority Hire Community Workforce Agreement and its Public Works Women Minority Business Enterprise Inclusion Plan are designed to benefit women and minorities who have been excluded from City contracting in the past.

GOAL

CF G3	Capital facilities improve the lives of underserved communities, address historical community under-investment, and distribute services and amenities equitably to all residents.
POLICIES

CF 3.1	Make capital facilities accessible in physical design, language, and affordability, and relevant to people of all abilities, socioeconomic backgrounds, ages, and cultures.
CF 3.2	Locate new capital facilities where they would support a more equitable distribution of services and address the needs of underserved communities.
CF 3.3	Apply consistent and equitable standards for the provision of community and customer amenities when they are needed to offset the impact of construction projects, ongoing operations, and facility maintenance practices.
CF 3.4	Seek to mitigate environmental and displacement impacts from the construction or operation of capital facilities on adjacent communities, especially lower-income residents, small locally owned businesses, and communities that already bear a disproportionate amount of such impacts.
CF 3.5	Adapt existing capital facilities to better meet the needs of an increasingly diverse population.
CF 3.6	Improve City-owned, community-serving facilities, such as libraries and community centers, to support emergency response associated with natural disasters and extreme weather events, especially facilities located in frontline communities.
Improvements could include seismic retrofits, air conditioning, air filtration, and backup energy sources.
CF 3.7	Create training opportunities and living wage jobs, particularly for underrepresented groups and residents, through capital facility investments.
CF 3.8	Expand the capacity of community-based organizations in underserved communities to plan and implement community-led capital projects to better meet community needs.
CF 3.9	Consider alternate service delivery models that may be more resource efficient or that could better reach underserved communities.
CF 3.10		Structure user fees and scholarships to mitigate disproportionate cost burdens on low-income households.
CF 3.11	Prioritize investment in Seattle Public Library programs and resources so that they remain free and open to all.

Facility Operations and Maintenance
DISCUSSION
The operation and maintenance of existing capital facilities affects the efficient use of resources, resiliency, and carbon pollution. Maintaining capital facilities ensures these investments achieve long and productive service, avoid the need for the construction of new facilities, and reduce carbon pollution. The policies below apply to daily operations and monitoring of these facilities, as well as minor improvements to them.
GOAL

CF G4	The City's capital facilities optimize efficient and effective operations and maintenance to prolong their service lives.
POLICIES

CF 4.1	Employ energy benchmarking and building tune-ups for capital facilities.

CF 4.2	Develop and implement maintenance plans for capital facilities to make efficient use of limited financial and physical resources.
CF 4.3	Manage existing facilities with a resource-conservation approach to reduce energy use, water use, stormwater impacts, and utility costs.
CF 4.4	Plan for and provide resources for all municipal buildings to operate without fossil fuel systems and appliances by no later than 2035.
CF 4.5	Manage existing capital facilities to maintain healthy and safe conditions for occupants, users, neighboring businesses, and residents.


Non-City Service Providers
DISCUSSION
In addition to directly providing services through its own capital facilities, the City works with other entities that serve Seattleites. These include Seattle Public Schools (see next section), Public Health- Seattle & King County, Washington State, and King County, as well as other jurisdictions and nonprofit organizations. This can include joint planning, funding other service providers, and allowing other entities to use City-owned property. Working together, we can better provide services to Seattle's residents as the city grows.
GOAL

CF G5	Facilities and services provided by non-City agencies and organizations will equitably and efficiently meet the needs of Seattle's communities.

POLICIES

CF 5.1	Collaborate with other public and nonprofit organizations to construct or expand community-based facilities or public amenities.
CF 5.2	Work with other public or nonprofit agencies to identify and pursue co-location, joint-use, and temporary use opportunities in public facilities for community programs, services, performances, exhibits, and meetings.
CF 5.3	Join with other jurisdictions in King, Snohomish, and Pierce counties to explore regional funding strategies for capital facilities, especially those that serve or benefit residents regionwide.
CF 5.4	Use nontraditional strategies for service delivery, such as the leasing of City-owned buildings or funding of non-City facilities, where they would provide greater benefit to communities.


Public School Facilities
DISCUSSION
Seattle Public Schools (SPS) builds and operates public schools and pre-schools within the City of Seattle. As of the 2022-23 school year, SPS operates 105 schools serving about 50,000 students. The average age of SPS buildings is 64 years. Seventy-eight buildings are more than 50 years old, including 19 more than 100 years old as of 2021. The district also has 34 buildings that are designated City of Seattle Landmarks with nine others with the potential for landmark designation.
SPS prepares a ten-year Facilities Master Plan to project future capital building/facility needs. At the time of the 2021 update to the Facilities Master Plan, enrollment shifts during the COVID-19 pandemic created uncertainty about how those changes might affect future enrollment and capacity. Even before the pandemic, SPS experienced a leveling off of growth rates, perhaps due to falling birth rates, the high cost of housing in Seattle, or other factors.
SPS uses a variety of information to assess the need for capital investment in its school campuses, including building condition, learning environment assessment, student enrollment trends, and building capacity and equity tier designation. Over the next decade, shifts in enrollment may require consolidations and/or closures to maintain a system of well-resourced schools that can offer a broad spectrum of resources and educational choices. Also, SPS has committed to transitioning facilities off fossil fuels for all its operations no later than 2040.
The City and SPS collaborate in planning for educational facilities. They have a joint use agreement to share recreation facilities. SPS is a major partner in hosting the Seattle Preschool Program. The City shares data about population and housing growth to inform enrollment projections and SPS facility master planning. The City works closely with SPS to permit new schools that may require zoning variances and to support transportation improvements to make it safer to walk, bike, and roll to schools.

GOAL

CF G6	Seattle has a system of well-resourced, zero-carbon emission school campuses that support high-quality instruction and learning experiences and meet the educational needs of a growing city.
POLICIES

CF 6.1	Coordinate with SPS to plan for expected amount and distribution of growth in student population.
CF 6.2	Explore opportunities to reduce the costs of developing new schools, such as identifying surplus properties that could be available for school sites.
CF 6.3	Facilitate zoning and permitting processes that support the development of new or renovated schools, and where providing non-educational community benefits, the adaptive reuse of any surplus schools.
CF 6.4	Expand opportunities for joint use by the City and SPS of buildings, playing fields, and other facilities.
CF 6.5	Coordinate pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure to make it easy and safe for students and families to walk, bike, and roll to school.
CF 6.6	Encourage more walking, biking, and transit ridership for students, teachers, and staff.
CF 6.7	Support efforts to transition SPS buildings, operations, and transportation from fossil fuels toward 100% zero-carbon electricity.
CF 6.8	Encourage SPS to preserve and improve open space when redeveloping school sites.
